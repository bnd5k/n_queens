#this method is for doing a find and replace on an array of o's
board.each do |item|
  if item.index = item[sm]
      item  = 'q'
    end
end    
# move to sm, convert to q, 
# move to lg, convert to q,
# to to lg, conervt to q,
# move to small, convert to q
#
# untill...when?  until the end of the array, I guess.  You'll have to define the array as
# haveing n*n members.
